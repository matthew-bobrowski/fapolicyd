.SH NAME
fapolicyd \- File Access Policy Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfapolicyd\fP [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfapolicyd\fP is a userspace daemon that determines access rights to files based on attributes of the process and file. It can be used to either blacklist or whitelist processes or file access.

Configuring \fBfapolicyd\fP is done with the files in \fI/etc/fapolicyd/\fP. There are two files,
.B fapolicyd.rules
and
.B fapolicyd.mounts
 . The first one sets the access rights and the second one determines which partitions to watch.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-debug
leave the daemon in the foreground for debugging. Event information is written to stderr so that policy decisions can be observed.
.TP
.B \-\-debug\-deny
leave the daemon in the foreground for debugging. Event information is written to stderr only when the decision is to deny access.
.TP
.B \-\-permissive
the daemon will allow file access regardless of the policy decision. This is useful for debugging rules before making them permanent.
.TP
.B \-\-boost\ NN
increase the daemon's scheduling priority by this much. The number should be positive and less than or equal to 20. The default boost is 10.
.TP
.B \-\-queue\ NNNN
the internal queue of pending decisions is set by this number. It should be a positive number. The default size is 1024.
.TP
.B \-\-user\ NN
run as a particular user rather than root. This may either be numeric or a user name from the passwd database.
.TP
.B \-\-group\ NN
run using a particular group rather than root. This may either be numeric or a user name from the passwd database.
.TP
.B \-\-no-details
when fapolicyd ends, it dumps a usage report with various statistics that may be useful for tuning performance. It can also detail which processes it knew about and files being accessed by them. This can be useful for forensics investigations. In some settings, this may not be desirable as the file names may be sensitive. Using this option removes process and file names leaving only the statistics. The default without giving this option is to generate a full report.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
SIGTERM
caused fapolicyd to discontinue processing events and exit.

.SH NOTES
To get audit events, you must have auditing enabled and at least one systemcall rule loaded. Otherwise you will not get any events.
